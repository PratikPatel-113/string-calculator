# string-calculator This repo contains an implementation of the String Calculator kata, a Test-Driven Development (TDD) exercise. It builds a calculator that processes strings with numbers and delimiters for basic arithmetic. The project gradually adds complexity, including custom delimiters, handling negative numbers, and addressing edge cases.
